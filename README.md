# CNN_Model
This project aims to develop an image classification model using deep learning techniques on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model, built with TensorFlow and Keras libraries, is trained to accurately classify images into 10 different classes. The goal of the project is to evaluate the model's performance and improve classification metrics.
